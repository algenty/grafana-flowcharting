## Code Samples

Use fenced code blocks with the language specified, like this:

    ```js
    console.log('hello');
    ````

**Result:**

```js
console.log('hello');
```

For the list of supported languages you can use (similar to `js` for JavaScript), see [Supported languages](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/wiki/list-of-supported-languages-and-lexers).
